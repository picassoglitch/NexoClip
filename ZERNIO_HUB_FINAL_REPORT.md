# Quantor Publish & Engagement Hub — Final Report

13 phases, one commit each, built on the existing NexoClip Zernio
integration without breaking what was there.

## Quality gate (held every phase)

The repo was **not** green at the start — the gate was **no NEW
failures**, not repo-green.

| Metric | Baseline (start) | After phase 13 |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| pytest passed | 1176 | **1407** (+231) |
| pytest failed | 130 (pre-existing) | **130** (unchanged) |
| ruff (touched files) | — | clean |
| mypy --strict | 80 errors (pre-existing) | **80** (unchanged) |
| DB schema head | migration 035-ish | **migration 040** |

All 130 failures are pre-existing and unrelated (clip overlay, brand
kits, stream progress, the clip-review inbox, landing copy, a
`_USE_SUBPROCESS` transcribe stub). Verified by stashing the working
tree at the start.

## Endpoints integrated (Zernio)

connect (+ headless FB select-page) · posts (create/get/list/delete/
retry, customContent, platformSpecificData, isDraft, firstComment,
queue, scheduledFor) · queue slots (CRUD) · analytics (best-time, post
analytics) · webhooks settings · inbox comments (list/reply/like/hide)
· inbox conversations + messages (list/send/archive) · contacts ·
comment-automations · sequences (+enroll) · broadcasts (recipients/
send/schedule) · ads (campaigns/analytics/boost) · Discord embeds /
Telegram posts.

## Webhook events handled

`post.scheduled/published/failed/partial/cancelled`, `post.platform.*`,
`post.external.created/updated/deleted`, `account.connected/
disconnected`, `account.ads.initial_sync_completed`,
`comment.received`, `message.received/sent`, `conversation.started`,
`whatsapp.number.*`. At-least-once → every handler idempotent
(dedup on `payload.id`).

## What a streamer can now do

Connect accounts without ever seeing Zernio · publish / queue /
schedule / draft with per-platform captions, first comment, TikTok
privacy, YouTube title · see status live via webhooks · retry failures
(manual + one auto-retry on transient) · read performance (7/30-day,
no fake zeros) · see a unified calendar (hub + scheduled + native
posts) · manage comments + DMs of their clips · run comment-to-DM
funnels with contacts / sequences / broadcasts (Pro) · auto-notify
their Discord/Telegram community. NexoOBS publishes end-to-end through
`/api/internal/v1/publish` with only a service token.
