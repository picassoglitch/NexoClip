"""Phase 2a — dashboard-side helpers for bucket-backed clip artifacts.

Two access shapes, chosen by what the caller does with the bytes:

- pure serving (`<video>`/`<img>` src): `artifact_redirect_url` — a 302 to
  the bucket's stable public URL (or a presigned one). No bytes through
  the web box, no R2 round-trip on the request path (the redirect is
  minted blind; a missing object 404s at the bucket exactly like a local
  miss 404s here).
- local processing (ffmpeg render, waveform): `rehydrate_clip` — pull the
  cut original back into `clip.path` so the tool can run against a real
  file.

Both are no-ops returning None/False when object storage isn't configured,
so local-only deploys behave exactly as before.
