"""Background clip-render runner — Render Migration T1.

The legacy download path awaited `record_clip_to_mp4` inline inside
the HTTP request handler. On Railway a 35s clip rendered for ~4.7
min (seek-and-shoot at ~3.8 fps for 1077 frames), well past the
request timeout. Operators saw a permanent "Preparing…" spinner;
the actual render had been SIGKILL'd by the proxy.

This module is the background path. The download endpoint now:

  1. If the rendered MP4 is on disk → serve it (cache hit).
  2. Else flip the clip row to render_state='rendering' atomically
     (the SQL guards against double-dispatch).
  3. Schedule `render_clip_in_background(...)` as a FastAPI
     BackgroundTask.
  4. Return JSON status so the UI's polling Download button can
     show progress + swap to "Download MP4" when ready.

The runner itself:

  1. Calls record_clip_to_mp4 with a `progress_callback` that
     writes back to clips.render_progress_pct so the UI doesn't
     need to read events directly.
  2. On success: marks state='ready', progress=100.
  3. On failure: marks state='failed' with the truncated error.

Failures are absorbed here — we never propagate into FastAPI's
BackgroundTask runner because that just logs a traceback and the
operator sees nothing. The UI's status poll reads
render_state='failed' + render_error and surfaces a clear retry
button.

    """Guarantee the burned-in publish-preset MP4 exists, then return it.

    This is the shared guarantee behind "publish the same video you
    download". The download endpoint already lazy-renders this exact
    file (overlays + libass captions burned in via the headless
    recorder); the publish path calls this so Zernio fetches that same
    rendered file rather than the raw, unedited source.

    Behaviour:
      1. Valid cached MP4 on disk → return it (the common case once
         approve pre-renders).
      2. A background render already in flight (e.g. from approve) →
         wait it out (up to `max_wait_s`) instead of starting a
         duplicate recorder against the same output path.
      3. Otherwise render synchronously, inline, using the operator's
         session cookie (the /render page is auth-gated).

    Raises RuntimeError when a servable render can't be produced — the
    caller turns that into an operator-readable error. We NEVER fall
    back to the raw source here; shipping the unedited clip is exactly
    the bug this function exists to close.
