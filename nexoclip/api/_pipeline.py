    live stream ends, and if so, claim the stream + call `schedule(...)`.

    Separated from the webhook handler so it's testable without HTTP: the
    caller passes a `schedule` callback (the webhook hands in one that does
    `background_tasks.add_task(live_pipeline_runner, **kwargs)`; tests pass
    a collector).

    Skips (returns False) when:
      - the row is missing or not in 'live_ended' (safety),
      - auto-clip is disabled (`NEXOCLIP_LIVE_AUTO_CLIP=false`),
      - the tenant has no persona (emits a `pipeline.failed` so the operator
        sees why; they can add one + run manually),
      - another webhook already claimed the stream (idempotency).

    Returns True iff it claimed the stream and scheduled the runner.
