"""Render Migration R1-R3 — validate the produced MP4 BEFORE it can
be served to the operator.

The download path used to trust two weak signals:

  1. The recorder didn't raise → mark_render_ready.
     But ffmpeg can return exit code 0 and still produce a malformed
     MP4 (rare but real — missing moov atom, broken audio mux, weird
     timestamps). The operator then downloaded a file Windows refused
     to open with 0xC00D36C4 codec error.

  2. `clip_render_<res>.mp4` exists on disk → cache hit, serve it.
     But a partial / 0-byte / truncated file also passes `.exists()`.
     Combined with (1), an aborted hybrid run could leave a corrupt
     fragment that the next download click happily delivered.

This module provides:

  - `validate_rendered_mp4(path, expected_duration_s)` — strict gate
    used by the background runner before flipping state=ready. Spawns
    `ffprobe -show_streams -show_format`; requires ≥1 video stream,
    ≥1 audio stream (we always mux source audio), and a duration
    that's at least 80% of what was requested. Returns a small tuple
    (ok, reason). The runner deletes the file + marks failed on a
    False verdict — partial bytes never survive the gate.

  - `is_servable_cached_mp4(path)` — fast O(1) check used by the
    download / status endpoints before treating an on-disk file as
    a cache hit. No subprocess: size floor + ISO BMFF magic-byte
    signature ("ftyp" at offset 4). Designed to be cheap enough to
    run on every cache-hit decision without measurable latency.

Both helpers are deliberately separate. The strict ffprobe pass runs
ONCE at render time (the marginal ~50-150ms is free relative to a
full render). The cheap magic-byte check runs on EVERY download
request and gates the cache trust.

      - ffprobe parses the container (exit 0).
