"""FastAPI app factory.

`create_app(db=...)` is the single entry point. The DB must be passed in
already opened; tests share a fixture-scoped DB and production wires one
up at boot before calling `create_app`.

A `pipeline_runner` callable is stored on `app.state` so tests can swap
the heavy `process_vod` for a stub. Default points at the real pipeline.

When `enable_background_drains=True` the lifespan starts three loops:
publish_jobs (60s), webhook dispatch (30s), and metrics ingest (1h).
Tests leave the flag off so loops never spin during test runs.
