"""FastAPI lifespan — auto-drains for the metrics + webhook workers.

When `enable_background_drains=True` (default) the API server kicks the
background loops at boot:

  * webhook dispatch      every 30s   per active tenant
  * metrics ingest        every 1h    per active tenant
  * retention sweep       every 24h   all tenants (runs shortly after boot)

The legacy publish_jobs drain was removed (Etapa A): publishing now goes
through Zernio, not the per-platform worker. `publish_interval_s` is kept
on the signatures for back-compat but no longer starts a loop.

The retention loop is what actually enforces the per-tenant retention
windows. `sweep_retention` was previously only reachable via the CLI
(`nexoclip retention sweep`), so unless an operator SSH'd in and ran it by
hand, nothing on disk was ever reclaimed and the volume grew without bound.
The loop runs once shortly after boot (so a fresh deploy reclaims space
promptly even if redeploys happen more often than once a day) and then on
the 24h cadence.

Each loop iterates `TenantsRepo.list_all()` and runs the drain serially
for each tenant. Per-tenant errors are logged and swallowed so a single
broken integration doesn't kill the loop. Shutdown cancels + awaits the
tasks before returning.

Tests call `create_app(enable_background_drains=False)` so the loops
never start. The drain functions themselves are exercised by their own
test suites.
