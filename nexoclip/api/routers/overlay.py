"""OBS-friendly HTML overlay routes (slice M.4).

Each route renders a standalone HTML page that:
  - has a fully TRANSPARENT body (so OBS Browser Source can composite
    the overlay on top of the actual stream pixels)
  - reads all config from query-string parameters (OBS Browser Source
    doesn't pass headers or cookies, so per-tenant auth isn't on the
    table here — operators publish a "URL with my config baked in")
  - is self-contained: no external runtime deps beyond fonts the page
    @font-faces itself.

The first overlay is the Kick repost-page banner — the same brand
treatment NexoClip burns into MP4 exports, but as a live HTML layer
operators can use directly on their OBS scene or in a 3rd-party clip
viewer that supports browser sources.

USAGE (OBS Browser Source):
  URL:      http://<nexoclip-host>/overlay/kick?channelId=clavicular
  Width:    1080
  Height:   1920
  Custom CSS (in OBS): body { background: transparent !important; }
  ☑ Refresh browser when scene becomes active

Optional query params:
  channelId    user's Kick channel id (drives "KICK.COM/<channelId>")
  handle       follow-card @handle override (defaults to NexoClip's
               own Kick handle — "reelonkick")
  followLabel  text on the green pill (defaults to "Follow")
  scale        overall scale factor, 0.5–2.0 (defaults to 1.0)
  starfield    "1" to render the preview starfield background; OMIT
               for production / OBS mode (default = transparent)

The component lives in `templates/overlay_kick.html`. It's deliberately
NOT under the /dashboard prefix so it never picks up the dashboard's
tenant_binder dependency — OBS can hit it cold.
