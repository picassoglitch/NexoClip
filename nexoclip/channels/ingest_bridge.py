"""Production ingest callback for channel watches.

The drive watcher left its ingest callback stubbed; channel watches get
the real wiring: detect a VOD → `ingest_vod` (idempotent download + audio
extract) → persist the stream row → kick off the full pipeline via the
configured `JobDispatcher`. Downstream (clip → variants → auto-publish)
runs unchanged, with publishing gated by the safe trap.
