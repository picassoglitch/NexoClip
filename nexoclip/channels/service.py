"""Channel-poll loop — auto-ingest new VODs from creator channels.

The auto-ingest counterpart to `nexoclip.drive.service`. Per-watch:

  1. List the channel's recent uploads via yt-dlp (flat — metadata only,
     no media download).
  2. For each video whose id is NOT in `seen_video_ids`, call
     `ingest_callback(tenant_id, vod_url, video_id, persona_id, language)`
     — which ingests the VOD and kicks off the pipeline.
  3. Append ingested ids to `seen_video_ids`; advance `last_polled_at`
     only on a clean pass (mirrors the drive watcher's failure handling).

First-poll guard: a brand-new watch only ingests the newest
`max_per_poll` videos and marks the rest of the listed window as seen, so
connecting a channel with a deep back-catalog doesn't flood the pipeline.
Later polls ingest up to `max_per_poll` fresh uploads per pass.
