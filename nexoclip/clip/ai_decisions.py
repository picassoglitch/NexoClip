"""Slice L.6 — viral-intelligence decision engine.

Operator spec called out the keystone behavior: "The AI should
dynamically decide: Does this clip need a hook? Does it need
subtitles? Is face visible? Is gameplay important? Will platform UI
block text? Is the reaction more important than captions? The
system should optimize for attention retention, not template
correctness."

This module is the single source of truth for those decisions. It
reads the signals NexoClip already computes (face_presence,
speaking_intensity, reaction_confidence, heuristic_reason from the
ClipBreakdown; face_zone from the framing verdict; clip duration)
and emits an `AIDecisions` object. The editor uses it to:

  1. Show ✨ intelligence lines on the verdict card so the operator
     sees what the AI noticed.
  2. Cascade settings when the operator picks "Auto Viral" — the
     recommended caption position lands automatically.
  3. Suppress UI elements when the AI decides they hurt the clip
     (e.g. hide the secondary hook on pure-reaction clips).

The decision rules are intentionally CONSERVATIVE — when the
signals are absent or ambiguous, the engine defaults to "show the
standard hook + captions" so the operator never sees an
overly-stripped preview from a weak signal.

This is a pure function: no I/O, no DB, no LLM. Lives in
`nexoclip.clip` (not `nexoclip.detect`) because the consumers are
post-detection (publishability, editor, burn).
