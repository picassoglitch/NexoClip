"""Confidence breakdown for a single clip — the "why this clip?" panel.

Joins three already-persisted tables for the bound tenant:
  * `visual_signals` -> motion_score (avg motion_energy across the clip's
    seconds) + face_presence (frac of seconds with a detected face).
  * `transcripts.segments_json` -> speaking_intensity (words per second
    during the clip's window).
  * `candidates` -> reaction_confidence (rescore_score) +
    rescore_delta (rescore_score - heuristic_score).

This is the observability hook your scope-adjusted PHASE_2 mandated:
without it, "why did the system pick THIS clip?" stays a guessing game.
The dashboard renders the dataclass; tests pin the math.
