"""Shared per-clip frame sampling — Task 1c.

The three OpenCV passes that ran independently before this module —
`compute_smart_crop_box`, `analyze_framing`, `pick_thumbnail` — each
opened the source VOD, seeked to N timestamps, and decoded N frames.
On a multi-gigabyte source video that's three full seek-cascades worth
of wasted I/O per clip.

This module opens the source ONCE per clip, samples N frames spread
across the window, and returns a `ClipFrameBatch` that downstream
consumers reuse. Each consumer has a matching `_from_frames` entry
point next to its legacy one (`compute_smart_crop_box_from_frames`,
`analyze_framing_from_frames`, `pick_thumbnail_from_frames`); the cut
service prefers the batch path and falls back to the per-pass path
when the batch can't be built (test stubs, unreadable codecs, no
OpenCV installed).

DEFAULT_SAMPLE_N is sized to the most demanding consumer:
`pick_thumbnail` defaults to 10. Smart-crop and framing only need 5–6
but reading the same 10 BGR ndarrays costs nothing extra — the haar
cascade pass that follows is independent of how many frames the source
had to decode.

    """Decoded frames + source metadata for one clip window.

    `frames_bgr` are raw OpenCV BGR ndarrays at the source resolution
    — consumers run cv2 ops on them directly. `sample_times` is the
    source-relative timestamp each frame was decoded at (NOT
    clip-relative); the thumbnail picker stamps this into its
    breakdown so the on-disk filename matches the source coord
    system, same as the legacy pick_thumbnail.

    `__len__` returns the actual decoded count, which may be less
    than the requested sample_n when the source ran out of frames
    near the edges.
