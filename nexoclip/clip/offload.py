"""Phase 2a — R2 offload for clip artifacts.

After the cut (and auto-correct, which may re-cut the file), each clip's
`clip.mp4` + `thumbnail.jpg` uploads to the object store so the local
volume stops being the only copy. The dashboard serves from disk when the
file is warm and falls back to the bucket when it isn't — which is what
lets the pipeline run on a worker whose disk evaporates after the run
(Phase 2b), and lets retention treat local files as reclaimable cache.

Everything here is best-effort: an R2 hiccup logs and moves on. Local
serving still works while the file is on disk, and the publish path's
`resolve_publish_media_url` re-uploads its render independently.
