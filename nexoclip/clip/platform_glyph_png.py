"""Rasterize simple white monochrome platform glyphs into PNGs once.

Sibling of `kick_logo_png` — but where Kick gets its full brand wordmark
(the repost-page variant), the OTHER source platforms (YouTube, Twitch,
X/Twitter) credit their source with a branded color band + a small white
monochrome glyph instead of reproducing each platform's exact trademarked
logo. A play triangle reads as YouTube, a chat bubble as Twitch, an X as
X — recognizable at a glance without shipping third-party brand art.

Each glyph is a handful of PIL primitives on a transparent square canvas,
rendered once per process and cached on disk next to the Kick wordmark in
`nexoclip/api/static/` so the editor preview (by URL) and the ffmpeg burn
(by absolute path) read the identical file.

The burn composites the glyph the same way the Kick wordmark does — via a
`__PNG_OVERLAY__:key=<platform>` sentinel that `overlay_burn.burn_overlays`
swaps for a second ffmpeg input + `overlay=` in a `-filter_complex` graph.
