"""Publishability verdict — slice I.3.

Separate from `viral_score`: viral asks "is this clip cookable?";
publishability asks "is THIS render safe to ship?" The two are
correlated but not the same — a 95-viral clip with captions covered by
the platform's caption dock is NOT publish-ready.

The verdict combines:

  - hook clarity        (title/top hook text present + readable)
  - caption readability (words-per-second band)
  - face / subject presence
  - motion + audio energy (rough proxy for "something is happening")
  - safe-zone compliance (no critical zone collisions)
  - dead-air risk
  - clip style completeness (banner URL set when banner is on)
  - integrity flags     (G.4 — reserved hook, currently always pass)

Scored 0-100 and bucketed:

  publish_ready : 75-100  - ship without manual review
  needs_edit    : 55-74   - one or two fixable issues
  reject        : 0-54    - structural problems

Each item that contributes contributes a `reason` (positive) or a
`warning` (negative). The dashboard renders them as the AI Director
checklist alongside the score ring.
