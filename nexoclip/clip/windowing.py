"""Dynamic clip windowing — slice G.1.

Replaces the static `pre_roll_s = 30 / post_roll_s = 15` defaults from
`ClipConfig` with a per-candidate window that:

  1. Picks a target *duration band* based on the candidate's kind:
       - reaction      → 10-22s (humor / laugh / shock)
       - quote         → 12-25s (quotable / hot_take / controversial)
       - story         → 35-60s (drama / emotional / vulnerable)
       - retroactive   → ≤60s, anchored at the trigger (backward only)
       - default       → 30s pre-roll / 15s post-roll (legacy)

  2. Snaps start/end to clean boundaries using the transcript's segment
     punctuation. We never start in the middle of a sentence — start
     gets pulled BACK to the previous segment boundary inside the band.
     Similarly the end is extended FORWARD to the next segment boundary
     within tolerance.

  3. Falls back to the static `ClipConfig` numbers when transcript
     boundaries aren't available (e.g. no transcript, no overlap).

The output is a `WindowPlan` with the chosen `start_s` / `end_s` plus
a short `reason` string so the dashboard can show "started at sentence
boundary, ended after laugh peak".

Audio-energy-drop + scene-cut snapping are future work — the signature
of `plan_clip_window` is set up for them via optional inputs.
