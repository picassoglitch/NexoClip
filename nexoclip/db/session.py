"""Convenience helpers for opening the DB + binding a tenant in one go.

The orchestrator and every CLI handler that touches the DB go through
`db_session(...)` so we have a single place where:
    * the SQLite file is opened
    * migrations are applied
    * the tenant is bound to the contextvar
    * the connection is closed on exit (even on error)
