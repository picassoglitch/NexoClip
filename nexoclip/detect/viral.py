"""LLM-based viral-moment detector.

Reads the full transcript, asks Claude (or whichever provider the router
picks for `viral_detection`) to identify the moments most likely to go
viral on TikTok / Reels / YouTube Shorts. Returns one Candidate per moment.

This is the universal detector — it works on any content, not just streams
where the host explicitly says 'clipéalo'. Particularly useful for:

  * Controversy / hot takes (the user noticed these go viral)
  * Emotional peaks (laughter, anger, shock)
  * Quotable one-liners that work standalone
  * Drama / interpersonal conflict

Costs one LLM call per stream (not per moment), so it's cheap even on long
VODs. Falls back gracefully — if the call fails or the budget governor
trips, returns an empty list and the pipeline continues with whatever the
heuristic detectors found.

You are analyzing a livestream transcript to find the moments most likely \

for the kind of moments that make a scroller stop and a friend share with \
another friend.

Score on 0.0-1.0 for VIRAL POTENTIAL. Things that work:
  * Hot takes / strong opinions — especially counter-narrative or controversial
  * Emotional peaks — anger, shock, vulnerability, infectious laughter
  * Quotable one-liners that punch standalone, no setup needed
  * Drama / conflict — between speakers, with audience, with a topic
  * Shocking revelations or genuinely unexpected statements
  * Moments where the speaker is clearly fired up or breaking script

Do NOT pick:
  * Dead air, transitions, sign-on / sign-off, sponsor reads
  * Generic banter, meta-commentary about the stream itself
  * Low-effort content the speaker is clearly phoning in
  * Moments without a clear hook in the first 3 seconds

For each moment include:
  * timestamp_s: where it starts in the VOD (use the [HH:MM:SS] markers below)
  * duration_s: how long the interesting bit lasts, 5-60s typically
  * score: 0.0-1.0. Be selective. Reserve 0.8+ for genuine bangers.
  * reason: one line explaining why this would go viral
  * type: classify the trigger from {controversial, emotional, quotable, \
hot_take, drama, humor, shock, vulnerable, other}
  * transcript_snippet: the actual words, copied verbatim from the transcript

Return the top moments ranked by score. If the transcript doesn't have \
genuine viral content, return fewer moments or an empty list. Do NOT pad.
