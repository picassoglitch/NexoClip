"""Task A2 — derive a Diarization from a transcript's per-utterance
speaker labels (AssemblyAI's `speaker_labels=true` output).

When the operator opts into `detection.diarization.source="transcribe"`,
the pipeline skips the GPU-bound pyannote pass entirely and calls
`diarization_from_transcript()` after the transcribe step to materialize
a Diarization with the same shape every downstream consumer
(detect.service, persona/brand-per-speaker code, dashboard surfaces)
already reads.

What we lose by going through transcribe-speakers instead of pyannote:
  * Embeddings — AssemblyAI doesn't emit a voice fingerprint. The
    cross-video `resolve_speakers` step needs embeddings to match
    a new VOD's "speaker A" against the tenant's persistent identity,
    so we skip resolve_speakers when this adapter is in play. Speaker
    labels are PER-VIDEO only.
  * Sub-utterance precision — pyannote can split a single sentence
    into two turns when two speakers overlap; AssemblyAI assigns the
    whole utterance to one speaker. Acceptable for v1; the overlap
    case is rare in single-host content.

What stays the same:
  * `diarization.overlap_speaker(ts, end_ts)` works identically.
  * `diarization.speaker_label_at(timestamp)` works identically.
  * Downstream candidate.evidence['speaker_label'] keeps reading the
    same field, so persona/brand selection on a per-speaker basis is
    unchanged.

TODO (cross-video identity): re-add embeddings via a Modal job that
runs pyannote-embedding on the audio file, AFTER we know whether
the cross-video speaker UX actually drives conversion. Until then
this adapter ships the per-video labels alone.
