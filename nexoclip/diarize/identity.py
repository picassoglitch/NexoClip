"""Speaker identity resolution — match a VOD's diarization output against
the tenant's persistent `speakers` table.

Cosine-similarity match per (within-VOD) speaker. When the match clears
the configured threshold, the existing speaker is reused; otherwise a
new pending speaker row is auto-created so the operator can label it
later in the dashboard.

Threshold tuning lives in `DiarizationConfig.match_threshold` (default
0.75) and `DiarizationConfig.min_speech_for_id_s` (default 30) — speakers
with too little speech in this VOD are recorded as VOD-scoped rows but
NOT auto-matched (too little signal to risk a wrong merge).
