"""In-process pub/sub for token-balance changes → SSE push.

The token-balance chip used to poll /dashboard/_balance/chip every 30s. That
burned a full request (auth middleware + DB read + template render) per client
every 30s, forever, even when nothing changed. This bus replaces the poll with
a push: the ONE place the cached balance changes (TenantsRepo.set_balance_cache)
publishes here, and the /dashboard/_balance/stream SSE endpoint relays it to the
browser, which then swaps the chip — so a request fires only on an actual change.

Scope / assumptions:
  - In-process only. NexoClip runs as a single uvicorn worker (Whisper runs
    in-process; see run.py / Dockerfile CMD), so every request — including the
    usage reporter that updates the balance and the SSE connection — shares one
    event loop. If this ever scales to multiple workers/instances, swap this for
    a Redis pub/sub (or a DB-trigger fan-out); the publish/subscribe surface
    below is intentionally tiny so that swap stays local.
  - Best-effort. A full subscriber queue drops the event rather than blocking
    the DB write — the next change (or the SSE reconnect) reconciles the chip.
