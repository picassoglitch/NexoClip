"""`emit()` — the canonical way to record one state transition.

Every state change in the pipeline lands as one row in the `events` table.
Phase 1 just writes the rows; Phase 2 will dispatch them to webhook
subscribers from the same source.

Behavior:
  * `db is None` → no-op. Phase 0-style invocations (no DB) silently skip.
  * Tenant comes from `current_tenant_id()` — never passed by the caller.
    If no tenant is bound, the write fails inside the repo and the failure
    is swallowed (events are observability, not correctness).
  * Failures are logged via structlog at WARNING but never propagate; an
    LLM call or pipeline step must not break because the audit row failed.

Event-type strings are stable across phases. Reserved types reflected here
appear in `__init__.py` as constants so callers don't typo them. Phase 1
emits `stream.created`, `clip.ready_for_review`, `stream.processed`,
`llm.fallback`, `llm.exhausted`. Phase 2+ adds `clip.approved`,
`clip.published`, `clip.failed`, `publish_job.failed`.
