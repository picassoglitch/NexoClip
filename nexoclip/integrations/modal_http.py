"""Modal web-endpoint polling protocol — shared client-side helper.

Modal's `fastapi_endpoint` for a long-running function answers the
initial POST with `303 See Other` + `Location: ?__modal_function_call_id=
fc-...`, and that polling URL keeps redirecting (302/303) until the
function completes (200 + JSON body) or fails (4xx/5xx). Both the whisper
transcribe provider and the pipeline job dispatcher speak this protocol;
this module is the single implementation of the follow-the-redirects loop.

Extracted from `nexoclip/transcribe/providers/modal_whisper.py` (Phase 2b)
— the behavior and the deadline-error message shape are unchanged.
