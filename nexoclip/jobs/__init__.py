"""Pipeline job dispatch — slice F.8.

The API layer used to call `app.state.pipeline_runner` directly with
FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`. That's fine for single-host dev, but
when the nexo-ai deployment lands we'll want pipeline runs to fan
out to Modal (serverless GPU) instead.

`JobDispatcher` is the abstraction that lets us flip targets with a
config setting. Today: `InProcessJobDispatcher`. F.10+: `ModalJobDispatcher`.

The shipping path-by-stage:
    Stage 1 (local dev, single host)     → in_process
    Stage 2 (nexo-ai deploy on Vercel)   → modal (Vercel can't run GPU)
    Stage 3 (AWS at scale)               → sqs    (queue + ECS workers)
