"""In-process registry of streams with a pipeline run in flight.

The disk reclaimers — the watchdog loop, the per-ingest preflight, and
the retention sweep's source backstop — must never delete a source out
from under a RUNNING pipeline. A multi-hour VOD spends long stretches
(AssemblyAI polling, LLM passes) without writing to `source/`, so the
mtime-based "recently active" check alone can't see the run and would
reclaim it mid-flight, failing the run at the next step that reads the
file.

Authoritative for the current single-host deployment: every launch path
(API, upload, live, channel poll, recovery sweep) funnels through the
runners in `nexoclip.api._pipeline`, and every reclaimer runs in the
same process. A future multi-worker split (Modal) moves this to a
shared store, same as the auto-program locks did (migration 055).
Ref-counted so overlapping runs on the same stream (rare, but the
dispatcher doesn't forbid them) don't unregister each other early.
