"""InProcessJobDispatcher — runs the pipeline on this host via
FastAPI's BackgroundTasks. Default for local dev + single-host deploys.

NOT durable: if the dashboard process dies mid-run, the job is lost.
The pipeline emits step-event rows along the way so the dashboard can
detect "abandoned" runs and show the operator a re-run button — that's
the current best we can do without a real queue.

Concurrency IS bounded: a single global semaphore gates how many heavy
pipelines (download + Whisper + ffmpeg render) execute at once, so a
redeploy-recovery backlog or a channel-poll burst can't stampede the box.
Excess launches queue on the semaphore and run as slots free.

For the nexo-ai deployment, replace this with `ModalJobDispatcher`.
