"""ModalJobDispatcher — runs the pipeline on the Modal worker app (Phase 2b).

The web box stops executing `process_vod` in-process and instead POSTs the
`PipelineKickoff` to `infra/modal_pipeline_app.py`'s web endpoint (same
bearer-token + 303-poll protocol the whisper provider uses). The worker
runs the SAME `default_pipeline_runner` against the shared Postgres + R2
bucket, so step events, failure surfacing, cost tracking and artifact
offload behave exactly like an in-process run — the dashboard can't tell
the difference, except the web box's CPU stays flat.

`jobs.active` semantics are preserved: the stream registers at dispatch
time and unregisters when the remote run reaches a terminal state, so the
recovery sweeper's and disk reclaimers' in-flight checks keep working. If
THIS process dies mid-poll the registry resets (it's in-memory — same as
in-process), while the Modal run keeps going and keeps writing step
events; the recovery sweeper's event-silence rules take over from there.

Sources that exist only on this box (`upload://`, `live://` pseudo-URLs)
can't run remotely — they route to the wrapped in-process fallback.
Concurrency for remote runs is bounded on the Modal side
(`max_containers`), not by queueing here.
