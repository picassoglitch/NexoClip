"""Provider abstraction shared by all LLM backends.

The router doesn't know about vendor specifics — it just calls
`provider.complete(...)` (or `complete_multimodal(...)`) and gets back a
`ProviderResult`. New providers implement the `LLMProvider` protocol and the
router calls them via the `provider_factory` injected into its constructor.
Anthropic is the only built-in provider; the protocol exists so a future
addition (or a swap to a different vendor) doesn't touch router code.

Phase 1 adds the multimodal surface; Phase 0 only used `complete`. Providers
that don't support vision should raise `LLMError` from `complete_multimodal`;
the router treats that like any other provider failure and falls through to
the next entry in the chain.
