"""Growth Publish allocation — decide WHICH clips go to WHICH platforms.

The shift the spec asks for: stop "Publish All" (blast every clip to every
platform) and start "Growth Publish" — the operator says *how many clips
today*, and the engine distributes them so each platform receives only the
clips that fit it, never more than its daily rulebook allows. The rest wait
in the queue.

Two ranked inputs drive it:

  * an overall growth score per clip → picks the day's *pool* (the best N),
  * a per-(clip, platform) fit score → picks, within each platform's daily
    capacity, the clips most likely to perform THERE (Phase 6 priority).

This module is pure: it takes scores + rules + today's counts and returns a
plan. Computing the scores (LLM) and executing the plan (Zernio) live
elsewhere, so the allocation logic is unit-testable in isolation.
