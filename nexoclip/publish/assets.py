"""Per-platform assets — every platform gets a different asset, not one clip.

The spec's Phase 3: instead of shipping the same `clip.mp4` everywhere, each
platform should receive its own filename, caption, hashtags, title, and first
frame so the platforms don't see identical uploads (which they down-rank as
cross-posted spam).

What this module owns is the *metadata* asset matrix — the part that's pure and
testable: per-platform caption (length-conformed + style-aware), hashtag set
(count-conformed), SEO title, first-comment, and a distinct filename. The video
re-encode / first-frame / thumbnail variants are produced by the render
pipeline; `PlatformAsset.render_preset` carries the platform key it should key
off (the branding `platform_presets` already vary crop/captions per platform).
