"""Growth Engine planner — turn scored clips into a publish schedule.

This is the deterministic core that ties Phases 1-6 together. Given clips that
already carry a Growth Score card + their composed content, plus the tenant's
rulebook and today's posting counts, it decides:

    1. fatigue spacing   — hold near-duplicate themes (Phase 4),
    2. publish/skip       — drop platform fits below the floor (Phase 5),
    3. allocation         — fill each platform up to its daily cap, best-fit
                            first, within the day's clip budget (Phase 2/6),
    4. scheduling         — place each post under the platform's min-gap +
                            jitter rulebook (Phase 1),
    5. assets             — conform caption/hashtags/title per platform (Phase 3).

Pure: scores + rules + counts in, a `GrowthPlan` out. The executor (the
hands-free sweep) renders + posts + records; none of that lives here, so the
whole decision is unit-testable without a DB, an LLM, or Zernio.

    Unlike `plan_growth_publish` (which allocates a single day's pool and

    by its own `max_per_day` + `min_gap`, rolling overflow to following days
    (via `plan_platform_times`). Best clips by overall score claim the earliest
    slots. Every eligible clip cross-posts to every allowed platform on which
    its verdict is 'publish' and its fit score clears `min_score`.

    This is what the dashboard's "Auto-program everything" button uses, so a
    39-clip YouTube backlog becomes ~3/day, 5h apart, over ~2 weeks — instead
    of 39 posts in one day every 30 minutes. Pure + deterministic given `rng`.

    `existing_by_day` ({platform: {YYYY-MM-DD: count}}) carries what PRIOR
