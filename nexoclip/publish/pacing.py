"""Per-platform publishing rulebook — optimize BEFORE publishing.

The growth thesis: account health is the top priority, above impressions,
watch time, and engagement. You protect it by never out-pacing what each
platform's algorithm reads as natural posting behaviour. So every platform
gets a hard rulebook — a daily ceiling, a minimum gap between posts, a
caption-length band, a hashtag count band, and a randomized delay so the
cadence never looks botted.

These defaults are intentionally conservative (the spec's lower-to-mid end of
each range). A tenant can override any of them per platform from the Publish
Center; `PlatformPacingRulesRepo` persists those overrides and falls back to
`DEFAULT_PLATFORM_RULES` for anything unset. Everything here is pure and
deterministic (the jitter takes an injected RNG) so the scheduler is testable.
