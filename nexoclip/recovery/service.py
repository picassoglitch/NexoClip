"""Pipeline recovery sweeper — re-dispatches orphaned ingest jobs.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The pipeline runs as in-process FastAPI BackgroundTasks via
    `InProcessJobDispatcher`, which is explicitly NOT durable: if the
    process dies mid-run (deploy, OOM, crash), the background task is
    lost. The URL-ingest path (`POST /dashboard/url-jobs`) inserts a
    placeholder stream row (`status="pending"`, `duration_s=0`) and
    defers the ENTIRE pipeline — including the download — to that task.
    So a restart between the 303 response and the task running freezes
    the row at `pending`/0s forever.

    Nothing recovered these: the dashboard's "abandoned" detector only
    fires for a step that is `running` with a stale `started_at`, and an
    orphan that died before emitting any `pipeline.step.start` has
    all-pending steps — indistinguishable from a fresh submission. So it
    shows "Downloading…" indefinitely with no re-run affordance.

WHAT THIS DOES
    On a loop (started by the API lifespan), find streams that are
    in-flight-but-dead and re-dispatch them through the same dispatcher.
    `process_vod` is idempotent (CLAUDE.md rule 4) — a re-download reuses
    the cached `stream.json`, transcripts upsert, candidate/clip inserts
    dedupe — so re-running is safe and self-healing across restarts.

SAFETY — what we DON'T touch
    * Live streams + uploads: only `http(s)` VOD URLs are recovered. The
      live (`live://`) and upload (`upload://`) paths have their own
      runners and their source bytes may be gone, so re-running the
      generic `process_vod` on them is wrong. URL ingest is the actual
      orphan class anyway.
    * Completed runs: a `stream.processed` event is terminal → skipped.
    * Surfaced failures: a `pipeline.failed` event already shows the
      operator an error + a manual re-run button → skipped.
    * Legitimately-running long steps: Whisper on a multi-hour VOD can
      sit between `pipeline.step.start` and `.done` with NO intermediate
      event for ~2h. So a stream that HAS started a step is only treated
      as dead after `IN_FLIGHT_SILENCE_S` of total event silence. A
      never-started stream (no `step.start` at all) is eligible after the
      much shorter `NEVER_STARTED_GRACE_S` — nothing is running, and a
      healthy dispatch emits `ingest.start` within seconds.
    * Thrash: each re-dispatch writes a `stream.recovery_dispatched`
      event; after `MAX_ATTEMPTS` we emit one give-up `pipeline.failed`
      (which then makes the stream terminal) instead of looping forever.
    * Ancient rows: streams older than `MAX_AGE_S` are left for retention
      — silently auto-running a two-week-old VOD is not what the operator
      wants.
