"""Process-wide governor for heavy OS-level work (ffmpeg, OpenCV decode,
headless Chromium).

Without a cap, three subsystems peak independently inside one process:
the clip-cut fan-out (`clip.service.cut_clips`), operator-triggered clip
renders (`api._clip_render.render_clip_in_background`), and the channel-poll
pipeline that runs the cut step inline. When they overlap they exhaust the
container's thread/PID/memory ceiling, and every subsequent fork /
pthread_create fails with EAGAIN — surfacing as decoder-open failures,
`x264_encoder_open` errors, and "can't start new thread". This module bounds
the number of concurrent heavy operations so a spike degrades into queueing
instead of a cascade of EAGAIN failures.

Sizing: `NEXOCLIP_HEAVY_SLOTS` overrides; otherwise half the CPU count
(floor `_SLOTS_FLOOR`). Heavy ops are memory-bound on our containers (each
ffmpeg / Chromium is hundreds of MB), so the default errs low.

The semaphore is created lazily per running event loop so the module can be
imported once and reused across the many short-lived loops that tests spin
up with `asyncio.run` — asyncio primitives bind to the first loop that
touches them and raise if reused across loops.
