"""Retention sweeper — hard-deletes artifacts past their tenant windows.

Three retention scopes:

  * **VOD** (source video + audio): the heaviest artifact. ~5-50 GB per
    4hr stream. Default 7 days. Normally the source is already gone — the
    pipeline deletes it on completion (see `delete_source_on_completion`);
    this window is the backstop for streams whose pipeline crashed before
    that cleanup ran.
  * **Clip** (rendered vertical clip + thumbnails): ~50-500 MB per clip.
    Default 90 days.
  * **Transcript** (Whisper JSON segments): KBs per stream. Default 365
    days — cheap to keep, useful for re-running detection later with a
    new ruleset.

Each scope is independent. A stream whose VOD aged out can still have
its transcript on disk if the transcript window hasn't passed.

Sweeper algorithm:

    1. For each tenant, resolve the three windows (col → system default).
    2. Compute three cutoff timestamps (now - window_days, UTC).
    3. SELECT streams older than VOD cutoff → unlink source files.
    4. SELECT clips older than clip cutoff → unlink clip + thumbnail files,
       DELETE the clip rows.
    5. SELECT transcripts older than transcript cutoff → DELETE rows
       (no on-disk file — transcripts live in the DB).
    6. After VOD-side artifacts are unlinked, DELETE the stream rows.
       The FK cascade nukes orphan candidates / events / etc. that
       wouldn't have been useful anyway.

`dry_run=True` walks the same scan but logs the plan instead of acting.
