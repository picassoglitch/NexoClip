"""Pre-publish Growth Score — deterministic, no LLM.

Given a clip's signals (duration, publishability), its composed
caption/hashtags/hook, and the target platforms, `score_clip` returns a
`GrowthScoreCard`: an overall growth score, a per-platform fit + publish/skip
verdict, and the clip's own content tags. The planner
(`publish.growth_engine.plan_growth_publish`) reads `overall_score`,
`platforms[].platform/verdict/score`, and `content_tags` off this card.

This used to be an LLM call (Anthropic Opus). It is now a pure decision tree:

    * per-platform verdict = the clip fits the platform's short-form duration
      ceiling (`platform_specs.fits_duration`) AND clears the publishability
      floor. An over-long clip is 'skip' on a surface that won't take it.
    * per-platform score  = publishability + a small duration-fit bonus, so a
      tight 20s clip outranks a 130s one on short-form and the allocator picks
      best-fit first.
    * content_tags        = deterministic keywords from the stream title,
      detect reason, and caption — comparable across clips so fatigue spacing
      still holds near-duplicate themes.

Pure and synchronous: no router, no DB, no network, no cost. `fallback_card`
remains for the degenerate no-platforms case.
