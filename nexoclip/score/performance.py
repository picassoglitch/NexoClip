"""Continuous learning — turn real per-platform performance into allocation
weights so the engine sends clips where they actually win views.

The spec's last principle: "every post updates the account's profile so the
next publishing decisions become smarter." This reads the per-post, per-platform
analytics (views) we already collect and produces a 0-1 weight per platform.
Allocation scales each platform's daily capacity by its weight, so a platform
that keeps earning ~0 views (e.g. YouTube on a channel it doesn't fit) gets
fewer clips and the winners get more.

Cold-start safety is the whole game: a brand-new channel's 0 views are "not
sampled yet", NOT "bad fit". So a platform only earns a reduced weight once it
has `min_mature_posts` posts with a REAL measured views number (Zernio's
no-fake-zeros rule leaves unmeasured views as None — those don't count). Until
then it stays at weight 1.0 (full allocation) so we keep gathering data. And a
penalized platform never drops below `_FLOOR` — it keeps a trickle so it can
recover if it starts performing.

Pure + deterministic: analytics in, weights out. Tested without a network.
