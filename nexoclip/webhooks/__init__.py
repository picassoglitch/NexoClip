"""Webhook dispatch — HMAC-signed event delivery to subscriber URLs.

The dispatcher reads new event rows since each subscription's
`last_dispatch_ts`, filters by subscribed types, signs payloads with
HMAC-SHA256(secret), POSTs to `url`, and bumps either `last_dispatch_ts`
on success or `failure_count` on failure.

Two callers:
    * `nexoclip webhooks send --tenant <id>` for one-shot drains.
    * The FastAPI lifespan task wakes every 30s and runs the same drain.
