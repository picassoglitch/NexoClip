"""SSRF defense for webhook URLs.

Two layers of defense — validator at registration time AND a re-check at
dispatch time (belt-and-suspenders against DNS rebinding, where a
hostname resolves to a public IP at registration and a private IP later).

Both layers raise `UnsafeWebhookUrlError` on rejection. Callers translate
that into a 422 (validator) or skip-with-disable (dispatcher).
