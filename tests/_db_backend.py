"""Shared test-DB backend selection: SQLite (default) or real Postgres.

Set ``NEXOCLIP_TEST_PG_DSN`` (e.g. ``postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:5433/
nexoclip_test``) to run the fixture-backed suites against a real Postgres
instead of a throwaway SQLite file. This exercises the actual production
engine — the asyncpg facade, the ON CONFLICT idioms, the PG baseline — with
no dialect drift.

Isolation model: the Postgres baseline is applied once (idempotent), then
every test starts by TRUNCATE-ing every table (except ``schema_version``,
which would force a baseline re-apply). That composes with the facade's
autocommit-per-statement pool, where a wrap-in-a-transaction-and-rollback
scheme can't. SQLite keeps its file-per-test isolation, unchanged.

The target DB is mutated/truncated continuously — point the DSN only at a
disposable database, never production.
