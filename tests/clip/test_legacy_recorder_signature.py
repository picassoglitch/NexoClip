"""Render Migration R7 — pin the legacy seek-and-shoot's progress_callback
plumbing.

Operator hit a NameError in production: `_record_via_seek_and_shoot` at
preview_recorder.py:450 referenced `progress_callback` but the function
signature had never received it. T1 added `progress_callback` to
`record_clip_to_mp4` but the helper signature was never updated, so the
call from the parent silently dropped it AND the helper body referenced
an undefined name at runtime.

This is the cheap test that catches the next time someone adds a new
log field / progress hook that references a name the helper doesn't
own. AST-level — no Playwright, no subprocess, no I/O.
