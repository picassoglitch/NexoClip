"""Render Migration R8 — pin that the render-path ffmpeg cmds DO NOT
pass `+faststart`.

Root cause of two prod failure sessions: ffmpeg's two-pass faststart
re-opens the output file after the first write to relocate the moov
atom. On Railway's persistent volume that re-open fails ("Unable to
re-open output file for shifting data"), and ffmpeg cleans up the
file as it bails. Result: rc=0 with no output → R5 raises loudly →
operator sees a failed render with no way to know why for a long
time.

Faststart is purely an optimization for in-browser progressive
streaming of an MP4 hosted at a URL. The operator's flow is download
+ local playback + platform upload; none of those care about moov
position. If we ever need streaming preview, run a SEPARATE
qt-faststart pass that doesn't have ffmpeg's delete-on-failure
semantics.

Test is AST-level: grep the file for `+faststart` token. Belt-and-
braces against a future "well, this one ffmpeg call is fine, just
this once" addition that re-introduces the bug.
